This repository contains a collection of files that work indepently, feeding the output
of each script to the next in line. The objective of these scripts is to mine all first 
and last name combinations from a website and run them through a mutation script that
generates a list of probable usernames for the company running the website. I still
need to go back and work out some of the bugs and create the script to put them all
together, but I wanted to go ahead and put this out there.
